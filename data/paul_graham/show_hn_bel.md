# Show HN: Bel

Bel is a spec for a new dialect of Lisp, written in itself. This should sound
familiar to people who know about Lisp's origins, because it's [the way Lisp
began](rootsoflisp.html).  
  
It consists of two text files meant to be read in parallel: a [guide to the
Bel
language](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bellanguage.txt?t=1688221954&),
and the [Bel
source](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bel.bel?t=1688221954&).  
  
For those who just want to see some code examples, there's a [file of
those](https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/belexamples.txt?t=1688221954&).
But of course the Bel source is also a code example, since it's written in
itself.  
  
Considering the rate at which I was discovering bugs before publishing Bel,
there are bound to be more remaining. So this first version is version C,
after Cunningham's Law.
